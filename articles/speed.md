Glue is advertised as

> Fast, dependency free string literals

So what do we mean when we say that glue is fast? This does not mean
glue is the fastest thing to use in all cases, however for the features
it provides we can confidently say it is fast.

A good way to determine this is to compare its speed of execution to
some alternatives.

- [`base::paste0()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/paste.html),
  [`base::sprintf()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/sprintf.html): Functions in
  base R implemented in C that provide variable insertion (but not
  interpolation).
- [`R.utils::gstring()`](https://henrikbengtsson.github.io/R.utils/reference/gstring.html):
  Provides a similar interface as glue, but uses `${}` to delimit blocks
  to interpolate.
- `pystr::pystr_format()`[¹](#fn1),
  [`rprintf::rprintf()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/rprintf/man/rprintf.html):
  Provide an interface similar to python string formatters with variable
  replacement, but not arbitrary interpolation.

Note:
[`stringr::str_interp()`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_interp.html)
was previously included in this benchmark, but is now formally marked as
“superseded”, in favor of
[`stringr::str_glue()`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_glue.html),
which just calls
[`glue::glue()`](https://glue.tidyverse.org/reference/glue.md).

## Simple concatenation

``` r
bar <- "baz"

simple <- bench::mark(
  glue       = as.character(glue::glue("foo{bar}")),
  gstring    = R.utils::gstring("foo${bar}"),
  paste0     = paste0("foo", bar),
  sprintf    = sprintf("foo%s", bar),
  rprintf    = rprintf::rprintf("foo$bar", bar = bar)
)

#>   expression      min   median `itr/sec` mem_alloc `gc/sec`

are fastest, followed by glue, then gstring and
rprintf.](speed_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)

While [`glue()`](https://glue.tidyverse.org/reference/glue.md) is slower
than `paste0` and [`sprintf()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/sprintf.html), it
is twice as fast as `gstring()`, and `rprintf()`.

Although [`paste0()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/paste.html) and
[`sprintf()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/sprintf.html) don’t do string
interpolation and will likely always be significantly faster than glue,
glue was never meant to be a direct replacement for them.

[`rprintf::rprintf()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/rprintf/man/rprintf.html)
does only variable interpolation, not arbitrary expressions, which was
one of the explicit goals of writing glue.

So glue is ~2x as fast as the function (`gstring()`), which has roughly
equivalent functionality.

It also is still quite fast, with over 8000 evaluations per second on
this machine.

## Vectorized performance

Taking advantage of glue’s vectorization is the best way to improve
performance. In a vectorized form of the previous benchmark, glue’s
performance is much closer to that of
[`paste0()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/paste.html) and
[`sprintf()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/sprintf.html).

``` r
bar <- rep("bar", 1e5)

vectorized <- bench::mark(
  glue    = as.character(glue::glue("foo{bar}")),
  gstring = R.utils::gstring("foo${bar}"),
  paste0  = paste0("foo", bar),
  sprintf = sprintf("foo%s", bar),
  rprintf = rprintf::rprintf("foo$bar", bar = bar)
)
