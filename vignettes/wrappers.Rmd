```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(glue)
```

Imagine that you want to call `glue()` repeatedly inside your own code (e.g. in your own package) with a non-default value for one or more arguments.
For example, maybe you anticipate producing R code where `{` and `}` have specific syntactic meaning.
Therefore, you'd prefer to use `<<` and `>>` as the opening and closing delimiters for expressions in `glue()`.

Spoiler alert: here's the correct way to write such a wrapper:

```{r}
my_glue <- function(..., .envir = parent.frame()) {
  glue(..., .open = "<<", .close = ">>", .envir = .envir)
}
```

This is the key move:

> Include `.envir = parent.frame()` as an argument of the wrapper function and pass this `.envir` to the `.envir` argument of `glue()`.

If you'd like to know why this is the way, keep reading.
It pays off to understand this, because the technique applies more broadly than glue.
Once you recognize this setup, you'll see it in many functions in the withr, cli, and rlang packages (e.g. `withr::defer()`, `cli::cli_abort()`, `rlang::abort()`).

## Working example

Here's an abbreviated excerpt of the roxygen comment that generates the documentation for the starwars dataset in dplyr:

```r
#' \describe{
#' \item{name}{Name of the character}
#' \item{height}{Height (cm)}
#' \item{mass}{Weight (kg)}
#' \item{species}{Name of species}
#' \item{films}{List of films the character appeared in}
#' }
```

To produce such text programmatically, the first step might be to generate the `\item` lines from a named list of column names and descriptions.
Notice that `{` and `}` are important to the `\describe{...}` syntax, so this is an example where it is nice for glue to use different delimiters for expressions.

Put the metadata in a suitable list:

```{r}
sw_meta <- list(
  name    = "Name of the character",
  height  = "Height (cm)",
  mass    = "Weight (kg)",
  species = "Name of species",
  films   = "List of films the character appeared in"
)
```

Define a custom glue wrapper and use it inside another helper that generates `\item` entries[^1]:

[^1]: Note that delimiters `<<` and ``>>` have special meaning in knitr, so if you're generating output for RMarkdown or Quarto, you should avoid them.

```{r}
my_glue = function(...) {
  glue(..., .open = "<@", .close = "@>", .envir = parent.frame())
}

named_list_to_items <- function(x) {
  my_glue("\\item{<@names(x)@>}{<@x@>}")
}
```

Apply `named_list_to_items()` to starwars metadata:

```{r}
named_list_to_items(sw_meta)
```

Here's how this would fail if we did *not* handle `.envir` correctly in our wrapper function:

```{r, error = TRUE}
my_glue_WRONG <- function(...) {
  glue(..., .open = "<@", .close = "@>")
}

named_list_to_items_WRONG <- function(x) {
  my_glue_WRONG("\\item{<@names(x)@>}{<@x@>}")
}

named_list_to_items_WRONG(sw_meta)
```

It can be hard to understand why `x` can't be found, when it is clearly available inside `named_list_to_items_WRONG()`.
Why isn't `x` available to `my_glue_WRONG()`?

## Where does `glue()` evaluate code?

What's going on?
It's time to look at the (redacted) signature of `glue()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
glue(..., .envir = parent.frame(), ...)
```

The expressions inside a glue string are evaluated with respect to `.envir`, which defaults to the environment where `glue()` is called from.

Everything is simple when evaluating `glue()` in the global environment:

```{r}
x <- 0
y <- 0
z <- 0

glue("{x} {y} {z}")
```

Now we wrap `glue()` in our own simple function, `my_glue1()`.
Notice that `my_glue1()` does not capture its caller environment and pass that along.

When we execute `my_glue1()` in the global environment, there's no obvious problem.

```{r}
my_glue1 <- function(...) {
  x <- 1
  glue(...)
}

my_glue1("{x} {y} {z}")
```

The value of `x` is found in the execution environment of `my_glue1()`.
The values of `y` and `z` are found in the global environment.
Importantly, this is because that is the environment where `my_glue1()` is defined, not because that is where `my_glue1()` is called.

However, if we call our `my_glue1()` inside another function, we see that all is not well.

```{r}
my_glue2 <- function(...) {
  x <- 2
  y <- 2
  my_glue1(...)
}

my_glue2("{x} {y} {z}")
```

Why do `x` and `y` not have the value 2?
Because `my_glue1()` and its eventual call to `glue()` have no access to the execution environment of `my_glue2()`, which is the caller environment of `my_glue1()`.

If you want your glue wrapper to behave like `glue()` itself and to work as expected inside other functions, make sure it captures its caller environment and passes that along to `glue()`.

```{r}
my_glue3 <- function(..., .envir = parent.frame()) {
  x <- 3
  glue(..., .envir = .envir)
}

my_glue3("{x} {y} {z}")

my_glue4 <- function(...) {
  x <- 4
  y <- 4
  my_glue3(...)
}

my_glue4("{x} {y} {z}")
```
