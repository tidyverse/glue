The `glue` package contains functions for glueing together character strings and R code.

```{r}
library(glue)
```

## Gluing and interpolating

`glue()` can be used to glue together character strings, such as text:

```{r}
glue("glueing ", "some ", "text ", "together")
```

But it's real power comes with `{}`: anything inside of `{}` will be evaluated and pasted into the string.
This makes it easy to interpolate variables:

```{r}
name <- "glue"
glue('We are learning how to use the {name} R package.')
```

And more complex functions:

```{r}
release_date <- as.Date("2017-06-13")
glue('The first version of the glue package was released on a {format(release_date, "%A")}.')
```

All valid R code works in expressions, including braces and escaping.
Backslashes do need to be doubled just like in all R strings.

```{r}
`foo}\`` <- "foo"
glue("{
      {
        '}\\'' # { and } in comments, single quotes
        \"}\\\"\" # or double quotes are ignored
        `foo}\\`` # as are { in backticks
      }
  }")
```

## Long lines

Glue comes with a number of features that make it easier to use when work with large quantities of text.
Leading whitespace and blank lines from the first and last lines are automatically trimmed with `glue()`, letting you indent the strings naturally in code:

```{r}
my_fun <- function() {
  glue("
    A formatted string
    Can have multiple lines
      with additional indention preserved
    ")  
}
my_fun()
```

An add extra newlines can be used if you want a leading or trailing newline:

```{r}
glue("

  leading or trailing newlines can be added explicitly

  ")
```

You can use `\\` at the end of a line continues to continue a single line:

```{r}
glue("
    A formatted string \\
    can also be on a \\
    single line
    ")
```

## SQL

glue_sql()` makes constructing SQL statements safe and easy
Use backticks to quote identifiers, normal strings and numbers are quoted
appropriately for your backend.

```{r}
con <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ":memory:")
colnames(iris) <- gsub("[.]", "_", tolower(colnames(iris)))
DBI::dbWriteTable(con, "iris", iris)
var <- "sepal_width"
tbl <- "iris"
num <- 2
val <- "setosa"
glue_sql("
  SELECT {`var`}
  FROM {`tbl`}
  WHERE {`tbl`}.sepal_length > {num}
    AND {`tbl`}.species = {val}
  ", .con = con)
```

`glue_sql()` can be used in conjunction with parameterized queries using `DBI::dbBind()` to provide protection for SQL Injection attacks

```{r}
sql <- glue_sql("
  SELECT {`var`}
  FROM {`tbl`}
  WHERE {`tbl`}.sepal_length > ?
", .con = con)
query <- DBI::dbSendQuery(con, sql)
DBI::dbBind(query, list(num))
DBI::dbFetch(query, n = 4)
DBI::dbClearResult(query)
```

`glue_sql()` can be used to build up more complex queries with
 interchangeable sub queries. It returns `DBI::SQL()` objects which are properly protected from quoting.

```{r}
sub_query <- glue_sql("
  SELECT *
  FROM {`tbl`}
  ", .con = con)

glue_sql("
  SELECT s.{`var`}
  FROM ({sub_query}) AS s
  ", .con = con)
```

If you want to input multiple values for use in SQL IN statements put `*` at the end of the value and the values will be collapsed and quoted appropriately.

```{r}
glue_sql("SELECT * FROM {`tbl`} WHERE sepal_length IN ({vals*})",
  vals = 1, .con = con)

glue_sql("SELECT * FROM {`tbl`} WHERE sepal_length IN ({vals*})",
  vals = 1:5, .con = con)

glue_sql("SELECT * FROM {`tbl`} WHERE species IN ({vals*})",
  vals = "setosa", .con = con)

glue_sql("SELECT * FROM {`tbl`} WHERE species IN ({vals*})",
  vals = c("setosa", "versicolor"), .con = con)
```
